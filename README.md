# JT's Style Guides

These are guidelines I use when writing code to make it very readable.  You'll notice I'm not a fan of squishing things together vertically or horizontally to save screen space - this was important to do in the 70s and 80s due to 80x25 character screens, but with moderns screen sizes and resolutions I'd rather see things lined up in colums and neatly organized tather then crammed in as compact as possible.
