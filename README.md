# JT's Style Guides

These are guidelines I use when writing code to make it very readable.  You'll notice I'm not a fan of squishing things together vertically or horizontally to save screen space - this was important to do in the 70s and 80s due to 80x25 character screens, but with modern screen sizes and resolutions, I'd rather see things lined up in columns and neatly organized rather than crammed in as compact as possible.  It may take more keystrokes (spaces and carriage returns) when writing, but when reading/updating/refactoring, it takes less time to decipher the logic (i.e. cuddled else ifs vs. lined up conditional statements).  Brace style is definitely a preference and a contentious one at that.  What shouldn't be controversial is to **be consistent** within a file
